Astrolabe adds a bottom fixed menu that follows the user as they scroll, in the bottom area of the screen.

== Description ==

**Currently this plugin is at its very first version, with limited features. NEW UPDATE WITH MORE FEATURES COMING SOON.**

With Astrolabe, you can easily add to your website a fixed dock menu at the bottom of the screen that will follow the user as they scroll. Nowadays most modern websites include this type of menu on mobile devices, instead of the typical menu on the top right area of the screen, which may be more difficult to reach on a smartphone.

Astrolabe is responsive by default, and works across all modern devices, screen sizes, and browsers.

Currently Astrolabe comes with two different types of menus, a minimal one for up to 4 short menu items, and another one that can be opened or closed with a button.

Astrolabe automatically fades out when the user is scrolling near the bottom of the page to avoid covering any important element on your website's footer.

More themes and variations of these menus coming soon!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `astrolabe` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** screen (**Plugins > Installed Plugins**).
3. Add some menu items to the new menu locations added by this plugin: Astrolabe Default Menu, Astrolabe Modal Menu, or both. The default menu can contain up to 3 to 4 items, with short words, while the modal menu can contain more menu items.

You will find the plugin options in your WordPress admin screen: **Settings > Astrolabe**.
